This project collects tweets from selected foreign leadersâ€™ public Twitter accounts, cleans and preprocesses the text, and performs several layers of analysis:

Sentiment Analysis: Classifies each tweet as positive, neutral, or negative to gauge tone and audience reaction.

Topic Modeling: Uses techniques like LDA to surface the main themes and subjects each leader discusses.

Engagement Metrics: Tracks tweet volume, retweets, likes, and replies over time to measure reach and interaction.

Temporal Trends: Visualizes how sentiment and topics shift around key geopolitical events or announcements.

Comparative Analysis: Allows side-by-side comparison of communication styles and sentiment profiles across multiple leaders.

Intended for researchers, political analysts, and data enthusiasts, this tool helps uncover patterns in how world leaders use Twitter and how their messages resonate with the public.
